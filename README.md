# Bulk-File-Rename-Tool

The Bulk File Rename Tool allows users to rename a large number of files, without having to manually rename files.

Sometimes, you need to name all the files in a directory according to certain conventions. For example, you can name all the files in a directory with File0001.jpg, where the numbers increase based on the number of files in the directory. Doing this manually can be stressful and repetitive.
